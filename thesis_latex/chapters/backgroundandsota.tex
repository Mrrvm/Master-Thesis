\chapter{Background and State of the Art}
\label{backgroundandsota}

In this chapter there will be an overview on essential concepts to understand this work, such as the representation of the eye orientation in the 3D space and the pinhole camera model. Two state of the art algorithms that can potentially solve the problem,  \acrlong{oppr} and  \acrlong{grat}, are described. As well as that, a method of robust estimation that enhances the solution will be presented.
