\chapter{Background and State of the Art}
\label{backgroundandsota}

In this chapter there will be an overview on essential concepts to understand this work, such as the representation of the eye orientation in the 3D space and the pinhole camera model. Some state of the art algorithms that can potentially solve the problem and enhance the solution will be presented. More specifically, the \acrlong{oppr}, optimization functions using the epipolar geometry relation and a robust estimation method are described.
