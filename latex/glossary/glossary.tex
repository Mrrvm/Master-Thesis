\newglossaryentry{homo}
{	
	name={homogeneous coordinates}, 
	description={In computer vision, an extra dimension is added to the coordinates of a point that makes perspective projection transformations easier to compute. For a point $[x \ y]^T$, any three numbers, $[a_1 \ a_2 \ a_3]^T$ for which $\frac{a_1}{a_3} = x$ and $\frac{a_2}{a_3} = y$ are homogenous coordinates. This three new coordinates are represented by "$\sim$", e.g. $\widetilde{a} = [a_1 \ a_2 \ a_3]^T$}

\newglossaryentry{gauss}
{	
	name={gaussian blur}, 
	description={The Gaussian blur is an image-blurring filter that uses a Gaussian function. It produces a smoother and less noisy image.}

\newglossaryentry{svd}
{
	name={singular value decomposition},
	description={Singular  Value  Decomposition is  the  factorization  of a matrix A into  the product of three matrices $U$$\Sigma$$V^T$   where the columns of $U$ and $V$ are orthonormal and $\Sigma$ is a diagonal matrix with positive real entries}

\newglossaryentry{skews}
{
	name={skew symmetric matrix},
	description={A Skew-Symmetric Matrix is a square matrix whose transpose equals its negative. These matrices can be used to represent cross products as matrix multiplications}
